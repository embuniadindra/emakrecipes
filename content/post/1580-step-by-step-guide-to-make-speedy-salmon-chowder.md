If i had some old bay i would’ve used that too. Add your salmon and some more of the fish juice leaving a couple ounces to mix your corn starch. Stir and simmer 15 minutes."
- "Thicken to your liking. I wanted a chowder like texture. So i used about 2 or 3 table spoons of cornstarch mix with remaining fish juice and add to pot. If you don’t have cornstarch use some instant mashed potatoes. Just mix potatoes with water or fish juice microwave then add to pot."

As a born-and-bred Boston kid, chowder holds a special place in my heart, and fish-based chowders doubly so, as a fish chowder was the very first dish I ever got to stick on a real restaurant menu. It was creamy, rich, and satisfying, and totally impractical for any kind of home cooking. At home, I take a much more traditional one-pot approach to chowder-making.
