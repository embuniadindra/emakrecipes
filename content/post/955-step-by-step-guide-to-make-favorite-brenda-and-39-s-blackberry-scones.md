recipeingredient:
- "1 cup fresh blackberries blueberries or other fresh ripe fruit"
- "3 1/2 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "2 tsp baking soda"
- "1 1/2 tsp kosher salt"
- "1 cup 2 sticks cold unsalted butter cubed"
- "2 tbsp vanilla"
- "3/4 cup buttermilk"
- "4 tbsp cane sugar"
- "2 tbsp coconut rum"
recipeinstructions:
- "About 2 hours before making the scones, scatter the berries or fruit on a cookie sheet and put in freezer. (If large berries cut in half)"
- "Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and drop in the cubed butter. Put the bowl in the freezer and leave it there for 30 minutes."
- "Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 375°F. Line regular or jumbo cupcake tins and set aside."
- "Using a pastry cutter or two knives, work the chilled ingredients together in the bowl until the butter cubes are the size of peas."
- "Make a well in the center. Combine the rum, vanilla and buttermilk in a separate bowl, and pour the mixture into the well.  Mix the ingredients with a wooden spoon to form a shaggy, slightly crumbly mass."
- "Add the frozen fruit and gently mix them in, trying not to crush them."
- "Scoop a small spoonful into your hand and press it into a tall, fat puck shape and put it in the prepared muffin papers."
- "Sprinkle the tops of the scones with the cane sugar."
- "Bake for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown around the sides but still tender in the middle."
- "Transfer the scones to a cooling rack and let them cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. Cool completely before storing in a loosely covered container. Store for up to three days, because of the fruit they will mold quickly, so eat them fast! :-)"
