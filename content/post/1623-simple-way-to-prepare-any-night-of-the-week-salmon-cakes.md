- "1 cup breadcrumbs"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1 tablespoon butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the salmon with the mayonnaise, worcestershire, green onion, seasoning, and breadcrumbs."
- "Taste the mixture! Make sure it&#39;s salty enough. If it&#39;s too salty, add more breadcrumbs. For extra flavor, throw in any fresh herbs you have handy."
