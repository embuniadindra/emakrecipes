recipeinstructions:
- "In a pan over medium heat add the butter, the water, the sugar and the zest of one orange by using a microplane or a zester or the zesting side of a grater. When the butter melts, add the cognac (or the orange juice) and the cocoa and stir the mixture."

- "When the cake is ready (you can test it by deeping a knife in the cake. If it comes out clean the cake is ready), cut it in pieces and then pour the syrup over it slowly so that it gets absorbed. Let it for about 20-30 minutes and then serve. Enjoy!"
