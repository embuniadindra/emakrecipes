Essentially, you need cupcakes (preferably in a people-pleasing flavor like vanilla). Once you learn how to make vanilla cupcakes yourself, you&#39;re all set when it comes to providing an extra special treat for all these occasions (and, yes, just because you&#39;re craving cake is a good enough occasion for us!). Reduce mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in three parts, alternating with milk and beating just until incorporated. Next are the wet ingredients: milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract and eggs. The oil is the fat component instead of butter and in my opinion, tends to make a more moist cake that stays moist for longer.
