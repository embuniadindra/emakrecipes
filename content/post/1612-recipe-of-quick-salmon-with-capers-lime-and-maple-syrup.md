##### The ingredients needed to make Salmon with Capers, Lime and Maple Syrup:

Drizzle the meat with the maple syrup. This was an interesting salmon recipe. The maple syrup is very nice for the taste buds, though personally, I&#39;d use a little less syrup. (I used the real deal organic maple syrup, though, so perhaps the taste was a little stronger?) Anyway, the problem I have with this recipe is the contrasting tastes. Heat a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
