recipeingredient:
- "3/4 cup Allpurpose flour"
- "3/4 cup Whole wheat flour"
- "100 ml Bran  or wheat germ "
- "1/3 cup Granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 orange Orange zest"
- "1/2 cup Unsalted butter"
- "100 ml Dried cranberries"
- "1 Chopped white chocolate"
- "1/2 tsp Baking soda"
- "1/2 cup Sour cream"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 tsp Vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the butter into 1cm cubes and chill in freezer. Preheat the oven to 175째C/350째F. Put the ingredients from all-purpose flour to the salt and grated orange zest into a large bowl and mix together."
- "Add the chilled butter and cut with a pastry blender or 2 knives (like making a bread dough) Then add the dried cranberry and mix evenly. Add chocolate here, too."
- "Mix the baking soda and sour cream in another bowl. The mixture of baking soda and acid is what makes the dough plump up. Then add the egg and vanilla extract."
- "Pour 3 into 2&#39;s bowl. Mix the mixture with a fork evenly. You may feel it is not moist enough in the beginning, but do not worry. When it comes together, push the dough at the edge of bowl several times to knead lightly. Then make the dough into a ball."
- "Put the dough on a cutting board lined with parchment paper. Spread it into a 20cm diameter, 2cm thick disk. When nice and round, cut into 8 pieces like a pizza. You can make your favorite shapes or pieces."
- "Line a baking pan with parchment paper, and place the rolls on it with plenty of space in between. Sprinkle with granulated sugar if you want. Bake for 15-17 minutes in the preheated oven. When the bottom of scones are browned, they&#39;re done."
- "Bran is very light and seems like it can float in the air, very similar to wheat germ. It&#39;s full of fiber!"
- "In step 2, cut the butter until crumbly. It takes time, but this is the trick to making crispy scones. It takes 20 minutes for me."
- "I used frozen cranberries. Fresh cranberries are sour, so sprinkle on a large amount of sugar and put in lots of white chocolate."
