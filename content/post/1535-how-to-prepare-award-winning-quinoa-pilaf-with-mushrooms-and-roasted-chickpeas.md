recipeingredient:
- " Chickpeas"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1/2 cup cooked chickpeas rinsed and dried"
- " quinoa"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "3 Mushrooms"
- "1 garlic cloves"
- " salt and pepper"
- "1/2 cup quinoa"
- "1 cup vegetable broth"
- "1/2 cup frozen vegetables"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F"
- "Drizzle the olive oil over a small roasting pan and add the chickpeas"
- "Give the pan a good shake to coat the chickpeas with oil and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over them"
- "Roast for 15 minutes, give the pan a good shake and roast for 15 more minutes or until the chick peas are golden and crunchy"
- "Let’s prepare the quinoa while the chickpeas are roasting. Preheat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat."
- "Throw in the mushrooms and cook for four or five minutes or until wilted and their liquid has evaporated."
- "Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add a little bit of oil if the garlic is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper."
- "Add the quinoa, broth, and frozen vegetables, cover with a lid and bring to a boil. If your broth is salted, you’re probably good to go, if not you will need to add salt to taste. I’d say 1/8 teaspoon, but hardier tastebuds might want to go with 1/4 teaspoon."

- "When the quinoa is done, remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for five minutes."
- "Fluff it up with a fork, mix in your roasted chickpeas and enjoy!"
