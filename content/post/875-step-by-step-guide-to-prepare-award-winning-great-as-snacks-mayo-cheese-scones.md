recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "6 grams Baking powder"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "50 grams Margarine"
- "100 ml Milk"
- "2 slice for the dough Sliced cheese"
- "2 slice to sandwich in the dough"
- "1 as much to taste Mayonnaise"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the cake and bread flours, baking powder and sugar in a food processor and turn it on. (This is done instead of sifting the flours...)"
- "Rip apart 2 slices of cheese, add them to the food processor, and pulse a few times. Add the margarine and process until the mixture is crumbly."
- "Add 1/2 of the milk and pulse, then add the rest of the milk and process until the dough comes together. Turn the food processor off when the blades are getting heavy."
- "Take the dough out of the food processor and place on a sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten and fold the dough several times over the plastic. Wrap up in the plastic and rest in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes."
- "Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, and press out to the size of a slice of cheese. If you fold the plastic wrap into a rectangle, you can press the dough out into a neat rectangle too."
- "Roll out each piece of dough while spreading out the plastic wrap little by little, making two equally sized pieces."
- "Squeeze out some mayonnaise on one slice, to about the size of the cheese. I usually squeeze out 2 lines of mayo, but I&#39;m on a diet at the moment so I just did one line."
- "Put 2 slices of cheese on top side by side. If you use a total of 4 slices (2 slices each) it will be even cheesier and more delicious. (But I&#39;m on a diet...)"
- "Add the other piece of dough on top very slowly. For any parts that are not overlapping, bring the plastic wrap over the top slice and neaten up the edges with a rolling pin."
- "Divide into 4 pieces, and cut each piece in half diagonally. Transfer the dough very carefully to a parchment paper-lined baking tray. Squeeze on some more mayonnaise."
- "I didn&#39;t have a thin-nozzle mayo bottle, so put some mayo in a plastic bag and cut off a corner to squeeze it on...but it didn&#39;t go too well. I should have cut the bag a bit more."
- "Bake in a preheated 200°C oven for 20 minutes. If you want to eat them toasted the next day, just bake for 18 minutes while they are still just lightly brown."
- "Attention! It may look like there are lot of steps and it&#39;s hard work, but I just explained things in a lot of detail so that the recipe is easier to understand. It&#39;s really easy-peasy. They are delicious cold too."
