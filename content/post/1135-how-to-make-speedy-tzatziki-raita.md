Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, tzatziki raita. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Tzatziki Raita is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. Tzatziki Raita is something that I've loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

Raita is a side dish from India while tzatziki is a Greek sauce. Both are eaten as dips or as an accompaniment to a main dish. Raita is made with plain yogurt and tzatziki is made with thicker Greek yogurt. Both generally involve some sort of herbaceous element: for tzatziki that means dill, mint, or parsley; cilantro often makes an appearance in raita recipes.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tzatziki raita using 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki Raita:

Raita and tzatziki share two similar base ingredients and some similar steps, but they are distinctly different. First, raita starts with dahi, a thinner salted yogurt, while tzatziki starts with thicker plain Greek yogurt. Tzatziki also has a heavy dose of lemon juice, making it decidedly more tangy than raita. Like it&#39;s Greek cousin, tzatziki, raita is a delicious, refreshing combination of yogurt, herbs, cucumber and either garlic or onion.
