Spoon a generous helping of garlic sauce down the middle of each pita, top with a pickle slice, and add chicken (our chicken tenders were on the smaller side and I put two in each pita). Shawarma refers to the meat and is most commonly served with pita and veggies like lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. Use the chicken in a salad, on a pita, or over rice.
