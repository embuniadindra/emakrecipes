But Pillsbury discontinued the icing mix, and the resulting clamor of home bakers led Pillsbury to release a recipe for making tunnel-of-fudge cake from scratch. You can make the original tunnel of fudge cake using frosting mix, or try this updated recipe made from scratch. The confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa in this recipe essentially replace the frosting mix.
