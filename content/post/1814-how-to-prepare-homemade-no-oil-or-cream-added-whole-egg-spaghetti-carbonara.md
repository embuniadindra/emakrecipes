recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Spaghetti"
- "2 slice Bacon or thinly sliced pork belly"
- "1/4 bag Shimeji mushrooms or any mushrooms of your choice"
- "1  Egg"
- "3 tbsp  Parmesan cheese grated"
- "1 dash Salt"
- "1 dash Coarsely ground black pepper"
- "2 to 5 tablespoons Pasta cooking water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the spaghetti in plenty of 1% salt water. (Drain the pasta a bit earlier than the cooking time indicated on the package, so it&#39;s al dente.)"
- "Cut up the additional ingredients. Make the ★ egg mixture. Beat the egg with a whisk until it&#39;s creamy, and mix in the Parmesan cheese."
- "Cook the bacon in a frying pan until it&#39;s crispy. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Add the mushrooms and any other vegetables, and sauté them."
- "Put the cooked spaghetti in the frying pan and mix well with the other ingredients. If there is not enough pasta water, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons."
- "Take the frying pan off the heat, add the egg mixture and toss quickly so that the egg doesn&#39;t set. Keep putting the frying pan on and off the heat (set to low) until the egg is creamy."
- "Taste, and see if the seasoning is just right. Transfer to a plate, add some coarsely ground black pepper to taste, and enjoy."
- "Here I used pork belly. If you&#39;re using pork belly instead of bacon, you should salt it beforehand. Pork belly will increase the calorie count a bit."
- "With these ingredients, 1 serving has 709 kcal. If you just use mushrooms (and no pork belly or bacon), it has about 547 kcal."
