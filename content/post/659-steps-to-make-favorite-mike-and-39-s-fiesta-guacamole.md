- "Wash and chop all vegetables and place in the fridge until ready for service."
- "● You&#39;ll want to choose your avacados carefully in order to make the best guacamole you possibly can.

- "Discard any brown portions of your avacado if there be any."
- "Scoop out all avacado from shells and place in a bowl."
- "Add all seasonings and the juice from one lime to the bowl as well."
- "Use a potato masher and mash avacados and seasonings together. Do not over mash. You&#39;ll want some chunks in your dip."
- "Fold all vegetables gently into your mashed avacado just until mixed."
- "● If you want to make this dip go even further than two servings, shred cabbage and place at the bottom of you serving bowls and place avacado dip on top of it. It&#39;s an old restaurant trick.   ● If not, just place avacado dip into two serving bowls. Or you can place it into one serving bowl if you&#39;re sharing the appetizer."
- "Sprinkle additional lime juice in the top of your guacamole to keep it from browning and garnish with lime wedges and fresh Cilantro."
