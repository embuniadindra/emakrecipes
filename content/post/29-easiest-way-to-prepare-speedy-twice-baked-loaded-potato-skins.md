recipeinstructions:

Add spices to desired taste and chopped green onion. Here is where I also sometimes add in 1/3 cup of the crumbled bacon as well."
- "Beat with mixer on high until desired texture is achieved. Sometimes I like to leave it a little chunky other times I make it more smooth and creamy. Depends on my mood and company."
- "Using a spoon, scoop mixture into potato boat halves. (About a half cup in each.) Line up side by side to support each other."
- "Top with remaining bacon crumbles, shredded cheese, and if desired chopped green onion. Bake in oven at 375° for 30-40 mins or until cheese begins to brown around the edges. Enjoy!"
