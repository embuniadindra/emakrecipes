- "Heat vegetable oil to about 158°F (70°C) then transfer it into a large bowl. Sieve in the flour and mix well with a silicone spatula or wire whisk."
- "Mix in the cold milk to bring the temperature down. Then add egg yolks and mix thoroughly."
- "Add lemon zest and poppy seed. Do a final mixing then set aside."
- "Using a hand mixer, beat egg white and lemon juice until foamy with tiny bubbles. With the mixer running, gradually add sugar in batches. Then continue beating until it becomes stiff peak."
- "Add 1/3 of beaten egg white (meringue) into the yolk batter. Mix thoroughly with a wire whisk or silicone spatula."
- "Add another 1/3 of meringue. From here on, we want to gently fold the mixture just until no white streaks are visible. Try not to deflate the air inside the meringue."
- "Gently fold the final part of meringue until it is 90% mixed. Check the sides and bottom of bowl for any unmixed batter with a silicone spatula. Fold just until combined. Do not overmix as the batter loses its air every time we mix."
- "Pour batter into a 6 x 3-inch round pan with loose-bottom. Shake the pan to spread it evenly. Tap the pan onto the counter twice to release any big unwanted bubbles."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean."
- "[Optional] Remove the cake from the oven after 20 minutes into the baking time or when the top crust has started to form. Using a knife, score the top to make 6 equal wedges and try to do this within a minute. Immediately return into the oven to continue baking."
- "Once the cake is out of the oven, place it upside down to cool completely. I do this by letting the edges of cake pan sit on the edges of 3 cups without touching the cake."
- "Before unmolding the cake, run a spatula along the outside edges of cake. Serve and enjoy!"
