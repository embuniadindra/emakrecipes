recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the grill. If using charcoal, try to use natural paper with vegetable oil in lieu of lighter fluid. Allow 20 minutes or so for coals to burn down to white, ashy surface. Grill should be 450-500 degrees."
- "Prep the salmon by patting dry with paper towel. Brush all sides with melted butter or canola oil. Evenly sprinkle seasoning on all sides, finishing skin side down."

- "While fish is grillin’, finish the hash. Reduce heat to medium or medium low. Add the minced garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Allow to finish crisping the potatoes."
- "Back to the fish- after salmon has cooked 6-8 minutes, and begins to flake, gently turn fillets over to lightly grill the top side for about 1 minute. This will add just a little color and char to the top."
- "Transfer salmon to a platter, skin side down. Lightly spritz tops of the fish with a few fresh-squeezed lemon wedges."
- "Time to plate! Make a nice bed of hash in center of the plate. Place a piece of salmon on top. The fish can be served with or without the skin as you prefer. Garnish dish with a pinch of chives or chopped green onion."

Salmon should be able to flake with a fork, but not be too dry. Drizzle a large dinner plate lightly with olive oil. Swipe each salmon portion through the oil (both sides) and place salmon in pan, skin side up. Place the salmon fillet on the grill skin side down (I put it over the hottest part of the grill) and cover. Place salmon on the preheated grill, and discard marinade.
