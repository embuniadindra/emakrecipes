recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 250°F. Place lard in large (turkey-size) roasting pan and place in oven to melt. Add bacon fat and set aside."
- "Prep all your ingredients while the lard is melting. The photo shows the cut sizes. A regular large roasting pan, as shown in this photo, is too small for cooking this dish. Use a larger/deeper turkey roasting pan."
- "NOTE!! I don&#39;t recommend a disposable aluminum turkey pan because lime juice eats a hole through aluminum foil! (I learned this the hard way!)"
- "Place pork pieces (fat side up) in the roasting pan with the lard &amp; bacon fat. Squeeze the citrus pieces over the meat, and place them around the meat pieces, skin side down. (The large piece with fat cap has a wide flat bone running the length of the piece, which is why it&#39;s bigger.)"
- "Add the garlic cloves, onion quarters and jalapeño slices to the pan. Sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin over the meat (to taste; I don&#39;t measure them)."
- "Lay a sheet of parchment paper over everything to keep the limes from touching the foil. Then tightly cover the pan with aluminum foil, sealing well all around so steam doesn&#39;t escape while cooking."
- "Bake in 250°F oven for 6-1/2 hours. Turn off oven and allow pan to cool before removing foil."
- "NOTE: At this point, I usually refrigerate the pork pieces (discard fruit and lard) and finish the recipe the next night when I&#39;m ready to serve it. But you can do it all in one day if you start early."
- "Char the pork pieces under the broiler. Keep an eye on them, flipping the pieces to get an even char. Takes 10-15 minutes."
- "Serve with warm flour tortillas, your favorite condiments, and refried beans."
