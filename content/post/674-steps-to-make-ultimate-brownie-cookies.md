recipeingredient:
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "4 ounces semi sweet chocolate"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "3 tbs cocoa powder"
- "1/8 tsp baking soda"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 350°F."
- "In a heatproof bowl, melt the butter and chocolate together over a double boiler."
- "While the chocolate cools, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium for at least 3 minutes. The mixture must look light and airy. The air incorporated by the mixer is what it needs to create the crinkle brownie like tops."
- "Add in the chocolate and butter mixture and mix until combined."
- "Add flour, salt, cocoa powder and baking soda. Mix until combined on low. The dough will be loose and look more like brownie batter than cookie dough."
- "Using a mini ice cream scoop or a small spoon, spoon the cookie dough onto a parchment lined baking sheet or sheet tray leaving 2 inches in between the cookies to allow them to spread."
- "Bake the cookies for 10 minutes."
- "Notes : If the cookies don&#39;t come out with the crinkle tops it&#39;s because the eggs were either too cold or not whipped well enough."
