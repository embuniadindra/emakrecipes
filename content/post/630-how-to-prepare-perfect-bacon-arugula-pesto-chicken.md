To make this pesto I used mature arugula from our garden (though you could use baby arugula too, it just isn&#39;t as strong.) I tried making it with both walnuts and pine nuts and strongly prefer this pesto with. Create an elegant meal with a store-bought rotisserie chicken and some tasty vegetables. Generous slices of roast chicken are paired with pasta and flavorful spices.
