- "Simply heat up a nonstick pan until it’s very hot. Then place the rolled dough on it. When you begin to see bubbles, flip over to the other side and watch as the balloon forms… Deflate or tap the balloon to go back and then arrange in a tray with a covered kitchen towel. Continue with the process until you are done...."
