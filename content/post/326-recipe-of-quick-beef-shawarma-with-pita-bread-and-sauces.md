Think of shawarma as a taco or burrito Middle Eastern style. The meat is then shredded and wrapped in a pita bread with garlic paste (chicken shawarma) or Tahini sauce (beef shawarma) and other goodies such as grilled tomatoes, chopped parsley, french fries, grilled onions, and salted Lebanese pickles. We make our own TASTY Pita Bread and AUTHENTIC Creamy Middle Eatern Sauces (garlic and cheese) using traditional spices. Shawarma typically consists of thinly sliced, seasoned meat that is piled into piping hot pita bread and topped with crisp vegetables or onion rings.
