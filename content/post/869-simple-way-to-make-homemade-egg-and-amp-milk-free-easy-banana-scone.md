- "200 grams Cake flour"

- "1 pinch Salt"
- "3 tbsp Oil"
- "50 ml Maple syrup"
- "1 Banana"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the banana into cubes roughly 5 mm in size. If you are using ripe bananas, you can cut them into larger cubes, as they will fall apart when mixing."
- "Sift the ☆ ingredients into a bowl (or you can fluff them up with a whisk). Add the oil and rub the mixture between both hands until there are no more lumps."
- "Add the banana from Step 1 into the bowl from Step 2, along with the maple syrup. Mix with a spatula. When the dough starts to come together, use your hands to knead it into a ball."
- "Gently press down on the dough from Step 3, into a thickness of approximately 2 cm. Cut into 8 slices and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 190℃ for 20 minutes."
- "It&#39;s also delicious if you replace the banana with steamed pumpkin! Steam 150 g of pumpkin (flesh) and roughly mash to substitute the banana."
- "The banana or pumpkin will get mashed as you mix it, so just mash it roughly while leaving some lumps."
