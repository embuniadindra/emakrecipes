- " Dried or fresh spaghetti check packet for amount per serving"
- " Chopped smoked bacon or lardons"
- "2-3 eggs"
- " Parmesan"
- " Generous dash of olive oil"
- " Creme fraiche optional"
- " Parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the spaghetti for the required time."
- "While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the bacon/lardon in olive oil until a little bit crunchy. Turn the cooker off so the bacon doesn&#39;t burn. It&#39;s best to fry the bacon/lardon in a largish, heavy bottomed saucepan as you will be adding the spaghetti to it and need it to retain the heat."
- "When the spaghetti is cooked, spoon it into the bacon/lardon mix (retaining the spaghetti water) and give it a good mix to spread the flavour and coat the spaghetti in olive oil. Heat it further if you wish but not too much as it will dry up and fry."
- "Beat the eggs. Grate a good couple of handfuls of parmesan into the beaten eggs then pour the eggs and parmesan into the spaghetti mix; mix them in quickly and thoroughly. The eggs should cook in the hot mixture."
- "If it looks too dry add a few table spoons of water from the spaghetti saucepan."
- "Stir in a tablespoon of creme fraiche and season to taste."
- "Pour into a serving dish, top with a generous amount of grated parmesan and garnish with parsley. Job done."
