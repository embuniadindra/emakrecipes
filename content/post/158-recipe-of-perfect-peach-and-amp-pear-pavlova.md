- " For the baking"
- "6 egg whites"

- " For the cream"
- "1 carton whipping cream"
- " Sugar as required"

- "Half canned peaches"
- "Half canned pears"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 150C/130C fan assisted and lay parchment paper on oiled try (or use meringue mix in corners to stick sheet to tray)."
- "Mix egg whites at high speed until foamy and cloudy. Then add 1 tbsp caster sugar at a time until soft peaks form and all sugar dissolved. When whisking the sugar in, turn down to medium initially so you don&#39;t get soft peaks before all sugar has dissolved."
- "Lower speed and then mix cornflour and vinegar and add. Also add vanilla essence and whisk all through the meringue mix."
- "Spread meringue mixture onto greaseproof paper and spread out but ensure middle not higher than outsides. This way maximizes the portions available by spreading across all of the baking tray. Put meringue in oven for 30 minutes then turn down to 90 degrees for 90 minutes. Turn oven off and allow to cool in oven for 1-2 hours. Take out and allow to cool for further 1 hour before removing from baking tray."
- "Lightly whisk cream and add sugar if required. I use 2 tbsps. Spread cream on pavlova and arrange fruit of your choice then crumble a Cadburys Flake on top."
