recipeinstructions:

(The green onion tops will be added later.)"
- "MAKE THE SAUCE:  Stir the cornstarch into the beef broth.  Pour over the mushrooms and bring to a boil stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Stir in the sour cream and blue cheese.  Stir until everything is well combined.  Add the cooked meatballs, cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes to combine flavors."
- "Add the cooked, drained egg noodles and gently stir everything together so the noodles get nicely coated with the sauce.  Add the green onion tops.  It&#39;s ready to serve!"
- "Enjoy!"
