recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180°C (upper and lower heat). Grease the cake tin."

- "Pour the batter into the greased cake tin. Bake for 60-70 minutes. Check the cake after 30 minutes; if the cake is browning too quickly, loosely place a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the cake. This will prevent the top of the cake to get too dark. Remove the foil towards the end of the baking time."
- "Let the cake cool off completely in the cake tin. Then turn out the cake onto a cake platter."
