recipeingredient:
- "1 ripe banana"
- "2 large eggs lightly beaten"
- "1 teaspoon cinnamon"
- " Optional mixins"
- "1 cup fresh fruit like blueberries raspberries or chopped apples"
- "2 tablespoons granulated oat"
- "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 tablespoon honey"
- "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mash the banan. Continue mashing until the banana has a pudding-like consistency and no large lumps remain; a few small lumps are okay."
- "Add flavorings if desired. Add 1/8 teaspoon of baking powder for fluffier, lighter pancakes, and whisk in salt, vanilla, cocoa powder, or honey to flavor the pancakes."
- "Stir in the eggs. The batter will be very loose and liquidy, more like whisked eggs than regular pancake batter."
- "Heat a pan over medium heat. Drop the batter on hot griddle. Drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan. Keep your pancakes fairly small. Not only will they cook more quickly, but they’re easier to flip. It should sizzle immediately — if not, turn up the heat slightly."
- "Cook for about 1 minute. Cook the pancakes until the bottoms look browned and golden when you lift a corner."
- "Flip the pancakes using a thin spatula. Cook until the other side is also golden-brown, about 1 minute more."
- "Serve warm and enjoy!"
