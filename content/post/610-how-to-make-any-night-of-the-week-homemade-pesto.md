- "2 cup Fresh Basil Leaves"
- "1 1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil"
- "1 1/4 cup Grated Asiago Cheese"
- "1 cup Pine Nuts"
- "3 small Lemons"
- "1 tbsp Minced Garlic"
- "1 tbsp White Balsamic Vinegar"
- "1/2 tsp Kosher Salt"
- "1/2 tsp Ground Black Pepper"
- "1 dash White Pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a dry non stick skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium-low heat until they are golden brown and give off a fragrant nutty smell.   Note: Pine nuts can be expensive, the most economical source for them has been Sam&#39;s Club."
- "Using a micro planar, remove the zest (just the yellow surface) from all 3 lemons and then juice all 3 lemons. Strain the juice to remove seeds and pulp."
- "Add basil (firmly pack the basil into the measuring cup when portioning), pine nuts, garlic, juice (strained) and zest of the lemons, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and white pepper to a food processor.   Note: Minced garlic in a jar from your local grocery store works great and saves time. Using jarred garlic is preferred as it has less bite than fresh garlic."
- "Process the ingredients until a paste is formed.   Note: You may have to scrape the sides of the container occasionally to get an even paste like mixture."
- "Using a micro planar, grate the Asiago cheese and add to the food processor.   Note: Parmesan or Romano cheese work just as well as Asiago. The slightly higher moisture content of Asiago makes for a creamier end product with a smoother flavor."
- "While food processor is running, add the olive oil.   Note: you can add more or less olive oil as necessary to reach your desired consistency for the pesto."
- "Serve and enjoy. This can be used on pasta, sandwiches, salads, or anything else you want."
- "This recipe makes a large amount of pesto. Pesto can be frozen for later use. A ziplock bag or a nice cube tray work well for this."
