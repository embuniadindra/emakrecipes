- "Add the butter into the bowl with the sifted flour and sugar. Rub and mix quickly with your fingers. Break the butter into tiny pieces. You don&#39;t want the butter to melt so work quickly!"
- "Add the yogurt and soy milk. Push down on the mixture with your hands to make a dough. Then add chopped chocolate to make a dough. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s still slightly floury. Do not knead the dough at this time, or it will not rise well."
- "Roll the dough out and fold into thirds. Then roll and fold into thirds again. Repeat this process a few times. (Dust if necessary)."
- "Roll the dough to a 2 cm thick rectangle. Cut into 6 pieces with a knife. Triangular or rectangular, either shape is fine Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated oven. When the scones have puffed and browned, it&#39;s done. Adjust the baking time as needed."
- "You can wrap the dough to let it rest for a while after Step 4 . You can leave it overnight, too. Bake it for breakfast - it&#39;ll make you feel so happy!"
- "Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside without drying out ! The chopped chocolate is so delicious."
- "You can keep them in a freezer. In that case, wrap them up tightly after baking. Defrost naturally or with microwave, and bake in a oven toaster, then they are as delicious as the freshly baked one."
