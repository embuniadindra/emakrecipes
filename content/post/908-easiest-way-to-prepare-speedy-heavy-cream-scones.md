recipeingredient:
- "180 grams Cake flour"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 Egg"
- "120 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 Flour for dusting bread or cake flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients from the cake flour to the salt in a bowl. Mix together with a whisk, turning it round and round in the bowl. This is the same as sifting the ingredients together."
- "Beat the eggs. Add to the bowl from step 1 with the cream, and fold them in using a rubber spatula. When the dough has more or less come together, take it out onto a work surface that has been generously dusted with flour."
- "Note: The dough will be sticky and hard to bring together as shown in the photo, but just take it out onto the work surface as is. Once you take it out, coat your hands with flour as you knead it. The dough will come together eventually!"
- "Fold the dough over with a rolling pin several times and bring it together."
- "Roll the dough out 2cm thick with a rolling pin, and cut out circles from it. I always use a cup for this."
- "Bake in a 190°C oven for 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on a baking rack. The scones will be split on the side and look delicious. They taste great even when piping hot!"
- "By the way, baking powder that&#39;s just been opened will raise the dough more. Once you&#39;ve opened the package, store it in the refrigerator."
