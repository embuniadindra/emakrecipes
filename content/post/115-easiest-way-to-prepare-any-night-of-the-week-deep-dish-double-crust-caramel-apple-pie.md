recipeingredient:
- "2 refrigerated pie crusts"
- "2 can apple pie filling"
- "1/3 jar caramel topping"
- "1 tbsp milk or cream  for top crust"
- " sugar and cinnamon  for bottom crust"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425°F. Allow pie crusts to warm to room temp while oven is heating."
- "Gently unroll one crust into ungreased pie dish (glass is best). Sprinkle bottom of crust with cinnamon and sugar (this helps the bottom crust brown/crisp better)"
- "Fill pie crust with 2 cans apple pie filling or as much as you can fit evenly into the crust."
- "Spoon caramel by small spoonfuls over top of filling. Don&#39;t use too much or the pie will be runny and the caramel will overpower the apples."
- "Gently unroll remaining crust over top of filling. Trim excess dough and crimp the edges of the two crusts together with your fingers. Cut three steam slits in top crust."
- "Brush cream/milk liberally over top crust - a milk wash will give you a beautifully browned crust."
- "Bake pie for 50-55 minutes, covering edges of crust with foil the last 20-25 minutes to prevent over browning. Let pie rest one hour before serving - best served warm with vanilla bean ice cream."
