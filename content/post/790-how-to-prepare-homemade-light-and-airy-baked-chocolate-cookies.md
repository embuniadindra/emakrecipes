recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the dry ingredients marked with ♥ (only 50 g of the powdered sugar) using a whisk, then sift. Sift the other 30 g of the powdered sugar in a separate bowl."
- "Whip the egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer. When the foam starts to become smooth, add the 30 g powdered sugar and whip until stiff peaks form."
- "Use a whisk and mix lightly to smooth out the bubbles. Preheat the oven to 180℃."
- "Sift the Step 1 dry ingredients into the Step 3 meringue in 3 batches. Using a rubber spatula, fold by lifting the batter from the bottom of the bowl."
