Marble chiffon cake is such a fun cake to bake. This time around I attempted a tri-color chiffon by using both natural cocoa powder and dark (Dutch-processed) cocoa powder. Dutch-processed cocoa powder has darker color than the natural kind. The color contrast would have been better if we use black cocoa powder, which is heavily Dutch-processed. This small marbel chiffon cake is the perfect dessert recipe for bakers who enjoy a little challenge.
