recipeingredient:
- "1 cup red lentils small a deep coral color"
- "1/2 cup red quinoa"
- "1/3 cup cooked brown rice optional"
- "1 small purple onion"
- "4 clove garlic"
- "1/2 bunch parsley leaves only"
- "1 1/2 tbsp olive oil"
- "2 tbsp almond butter optional"
- "1 tbsp raw tahini sesame seed butter optional"
- "1 salt and pepper to taste"
- "1 vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "The day before: Rinse lentils well, place in a bowl or jar, cover with water to twice the height of the lentils and leave to soak for 12-24 hours. In a pinch: boil a pot of water, remove from heat and add lentils. Soak for 30-45 mins and continue with recipe."
- "Note about optional ingredients: The rice makes the patties slightly fluffier, the nut and seed butters make them moist and add nutrition."
- "Prepare rice and quinoa. I like to make a large amount for a meal the day before and put aside enough for the patties."
- "Quinoa: Rinse well and leave to soak (optional) for 30 mins up to 4 hours. Drain, place in small pot with 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil, turn down heat, cover and leave to simmer for 15 mins. Fluff with a fork and leave uncovered for another 5 mins."
- "Rice: Rinse well. Place in pot with 3 times the amount of water (for example, 1.5 c water for 1/2 c of rice). Bring to a boil, turn down heat to very low and leave covered to simmer for 45 mins. Remove from heat and leave covered another 5 mins."
- "Drain lentils. Place them in food processor (or bowl for stick blender) with onion, garlic, parsley, olive oil, almond butter, sesame butter and seasoning. Blend until mixture becomes a pasty batter. You can stop a little sooner for more texture."
- "Add rice and quinoa to the mixture and check seasoning. Frying makes the patties bland, so the seasoning should taste a little too strong."
- "Heat oil in skillet. Spoon out or shape patties with your hands and gently place in oil. Fry both sides until lightly browned, about 3 mins per side."
- "Yields 8 burger-style patties or 12-16 smaller patties."
- "I have successfully frozen the mix, thawed it in the fridge overnight and prepared patties from it."
