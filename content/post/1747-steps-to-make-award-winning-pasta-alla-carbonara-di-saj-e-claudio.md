recipeingredient:
- "3 small eggs"
- "300 g spaghetti"
- "200 g Guanciale thinly diced"
- "60 g pecorino"
- "20 g parmigiano"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Salt some boiling water and put the spaghetti in to boil. Cook until al dente."
- "While the pasta is cooking, break 3 eggs in a bowl, add a little bit of salt and pepper on top of each yolk and whisk with a fork. Once whisked, add the grated pecorino and parmigiano to the eggs and whisk more till everything is combined. We like to use a ratio of roughly 2/3rds pecorino, 1/3rd parmigiano."
- "While the pasta is cooking, put the guanciale in a pan with no oil (the meat has enough fat to cook without oil). If you can’t find guanciale, use pancetta. Cook this until nice and crispy."
- "When the pasta is almost cooked and the starches are released in the water, take a medium sized ladle full of the starch water and put it in the egg mixture and whisk."
- "Once the pasta is ready, add it to the pan with the guanciale and turn off the heat. Once the heat is off, add the egg and mix thoroughly and fast to avoid the egg scrambling! The dish is now ready!"
