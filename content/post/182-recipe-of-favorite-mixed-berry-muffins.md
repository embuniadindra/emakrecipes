- "1 tsp. baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter softened to room temperature"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a 12 count muffin run with liners or spray the tons with non-stick cooking spray and set aside."
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set it aside."
