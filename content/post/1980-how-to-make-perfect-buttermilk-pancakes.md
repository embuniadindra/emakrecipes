recipeingredient:
- "2 cups all purpose flour"
- "3 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "2 tsp. baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp. baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "2 1/4 cups buttermilk at room temperature"
- "2 large eggs lightly beaten and at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "4 tbsp. unsalted butter melted and cooled slightly"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt until well combined, then set it aside."
- "In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract. Then, while you are whisking, slowly drizzle in your melted butter until combined."
- "Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a wooden spoon to stir it all together until just combined. It&#39;s ok if there is still a few flour streaks in the batter."
- "Grease a non-stick skillet or a griddle and place it on medium heat. Allow it to preheat before beginning to cook the pancakes."
- "Once your ready to start, scoop about 1/2 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet/onto the griddle. Allow it to cook until the edges appear set and bubbles that form in the batter begin to burst. Use a spatula to flip the pancakes and cook until the other side is golden brown as well."
- "Repeat this process until all the batter is used up. Grease between pancakes if needed. I like to keep mine on a large baking tray in a warm oven while the others are cooking, since I tend to only cook 2 at a time on my griddle. Serve immediately and enjoy!"
