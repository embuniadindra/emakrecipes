recipeingredient:
- "2 2/3 cup All purpose flour"
- "1 cup Natural unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1 1/2 tsp Baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp Salt omit if using salted butter"
- "113 grams Butter room temperature"
- "1/2 cup Oil"
- "2 cup White sugar"
- "4 Eggs room temperature"
- "2 tsp Vanilla extract"
- "1 cup Milk I used soured creamline milk but buttermilk works as well or sour creammilk or milk with 14tsp lemon juice or vinegar"
- "1 cup Hot water"
- "1 tsp Instant coffee granules"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375F/190C. Prepare the muffin pans accordingly."
- "In a separate bowl, add the flour, soda, salt, and cocoa and mix well with a whisk."
- "Cream softened butter with sugar. The mixture won&#39;t quite come together like normal but once your done, it should look something similar to clumpy wet sand (exactly what you want to think of when you make cupcakes)."
- "Add the eggs and oil to the butter mixture, making sure to mix thoroughly and scraping the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla."
- "Alternate dry ingredients and milk to the butter mixture, only mixing until just combined. You should start and end with the flour."
- "In a separate cup, dissolve the coffee in the hot water. Add it to the batter, mixing on low speed until just combined. If you want a mellower chocolate taste, the coffee can be omitted or you can play around with the amounts. Just be careful about adding more as it can make the cupcakes bitter."
- "Scoop into cups and bake for 15 min. If they need more time, drop the oven temperature to 350F/180C. Cupcakes are done when a toothpick inserted comes out with a few moist crumbs. As opposed to some other cupcakes, these are a bit more forgiving if over baked."
- "Let cool on a wire rack and then top accordingly. Pictured are chocolate cupcakes with raspberry purée inside and topped with a ganache. I also made a creamy peanut butter buttercream."
