Beat in eggs, milk and vanilla. I am very happy to have Katie of Chocolate-Covered Katie as my first guest post here on Skinnytaste. Her recipes are a great fit for Skinnytaste as they are all healthy and low fat, but she also brings something else to the table… all her recipes are vegan! With a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture just until combined; then stir in the milk just until the batter is pourable.
