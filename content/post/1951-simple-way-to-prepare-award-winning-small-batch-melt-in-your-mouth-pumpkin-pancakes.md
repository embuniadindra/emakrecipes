recipeingredient:
- "1 Tablespoon butter melted"
- " Wet mixture ingredients"
- "1 large egg"
- "1/4 cup whipping cream"
- "1/4 cup milk"
- "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "2 Tablespoons yogurt or sour cream or creme fraiche"
- "1 1/2 Tablespoons sugar"
- "1/4 cup  2 Tablespoons canned pumpkin"
- " Dry mixture ingredients"
- "2/3 cup All Purpose flour"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "1/8 teaspoon nutmeg or alternatively to the two spices just add 13 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine wet mixture ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk or mix until everything is completely and evenly incorporated:"
- "Then sift all dry mixture ingredients into wet mixture and add 1 Tablespoon melted butter and whisk again *just* until the batter is thoroughly incorporated and *just* short of completely smooth."
- "On a well buttered griddle or nonstick pan brought up to medium heat, pour the batter in generous 1/4 cupfuls, using the underside of your measuring cup to spread the pancakes out to a roughly 5.5&#34; diameter (it&#39;s a thick batter) and let them cook for roughly 3 minutes before flipping and letting them cook another 60 seconds or so."
- "Because this is a thick batter made with pumpkin, it won&#39;t bubble like regular pancake batter, so instead of using the bubbles as an indicator to flip, just try flipping at the 3 minute mark and if you can fairly easily shimmy your spatula under the whole pancake without cracking it, you&#39;re good to flip."
- "That&#39;s it! Enjoy with butter and syrup or powdered sugar."
