Tougher steak cuts like flank, skirt, sirloin and round are best for marinating long hours. Originating in the Ottoman Empire, shawarma is the Arab version of a stacked meat dish that is cooked on a rotating spit. Narrow on the bottom of the spit, and wider at the top, this cone shaped meat layered delight is cooked slowly.
