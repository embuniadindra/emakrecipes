- "Heat oil over medium high heat in a heavy pot. Add onion, garlic, about two thirds of the chadon beni and hot pepper and cook until it starts to brown. Add the tumeric, geera and masala and stir to coat the mixture in the pot. Using a slotted spoon, take channa out of the water in pressure cooker and place in pot. Stir to combine ingredients in pot."
- "Add another tsp of salt, mix, then add enough water from the pressure cooker to cover channa. Bring to a boil and lower heat. Let simmer for about 20 minutes."
- "Smash some of the channa against the pot with the back of a spoon to thicken. Add remaining chadon beni, one tsp of salt or more to taste. Mix and remove from heat."
- "To eat, take two baras, add a large spoonful of channa and garnish with preferred chutney(s) and pepper sauce."
