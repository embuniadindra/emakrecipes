recipeingredient:
- " Cake"
- "1 1/4 cup Flour"
- "1 cup Sugar"
- "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp Baking soda"
- "1/3 cup Vegetable oil"
- "1 tsp Distilled or white apple cider vinegar"
- "2 tbsp Vanilla extract"
- "1 cup warm water"
- " Glaze"
- "1/2 cup Sugar"
- "4 tbsp Margarine"
- "2 tbsp Soy milk"
- "2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "2 tsp Vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. In an 8X8 square pan/dish, mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt with a fork, making sure it is really blended together. Add the water, vanilla, oil, and vinegar, and again, mix together so that it&#39;s really blended together. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides if necessary."
- "Place in oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean. Cool on a rack completely (2 hours). Seriously, wait 2 hours, or it will collapse in the centre."
- "For the glaze, in a small saucepan, bring sugar, margarine, milk, and cocoa to a boil. Stir frequently; then reduce heat to a simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. It&#39;ll look gloppy, but it&#39;s just the bubbles! Remove from heat and stir for another 5 minutes."
- "Add vanilla, stir, and immediately pour onto cake. Glaze dries really quickly, so spread it immediately and add any sprinkles now. Let this cool for an 1 hour, if you can wait that long!"
