recipeinstructions:
- "This time, I used peels of 3 yellow bananas. Greenish bananas are better for &#39;meatballs&#39;, as the riper the banana gets, the thinner and sweeter the peel becomes."
- "Carefully wash the banana peels under running water, and wipe off the water."
- "Chop the banana peels, onion, and carrot, and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the oregano, nutmeg, flour, bread crumbs, egg (if you are vegan, use a flax egg instead), and some salt and pepper. Mix them all -- using hands makes your life a lot easier."
- "Cover the mixture and let stand in the fridge for 30-45 minutes. If you skip this step, your meatballs will fall apart so don&#39;t forget to rest the mixture."
- "Take out the mixture from the fridge, and form it into meatballs. I&#39;ve got 12 meatballs from the mixture this time."
- "Put the olive oil and sliced garlic in a pan, and turn on the heat. Sauté the garlic until fragrant. Then add the tomato purée, red wine, sugar, soy sauce (it&#39;s a secret ingredient...), and salt and pepper, and stir the sauce on medium heat until it starts to simmer."
- "Gently add the banana peel meatballs to the sauce. Make sure the meatballs won&#39;t stick together."
- "Simmer on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, with the lid on. Turn the meatballs halfway through."
- "Season to taste and garnish with parsley and parmesan. Serve hot!"
