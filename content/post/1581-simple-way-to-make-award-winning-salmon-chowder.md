In a large saucepan, saute celery, onion, green pepper and garlic in butter until the vegetables are tender. Add broth, potatoes, carrots, salt, pepper and dill; bring to a boil. Seafood is amazing in chowder and in this recipe, Lucinda Scala Quinn uses generous pieces of salmon and root vegetables in this hearty and satisfying dinner. Bacon and a little cream give this chowder lashings of.

Low carb, Keto and dairy-free adaptable! As a born-and-bred Boston kid, chowder holds a special place in my heart, and fish-based chowders doubly so, as a fish chowder was the very first dish I ever got to stick on a real restaurant menu. It was creamy, rich, and satisfying, and totally impractical for any kind of home cooking. At home, I take a much more traditional one-pot approach to chowder-making.

In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, onion, celery, chicken broth, garlic, salt and marjoram.
