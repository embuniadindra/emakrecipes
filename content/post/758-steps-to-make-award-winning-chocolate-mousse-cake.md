recipeinstructions:

- "Assemble the cake. Put 1 thin pre baked chocolate cake layer in the bottom of a 9&#34; spring form. Pour the whole mousse filling in, top with the second pre baked cake layer. Gently push the cake layer down, to make the filling even."
- "Melt the chocolate and coconut oil together and pour the warm almond milk over it. Stir it and pour it over the top layer. Keep it in the fridge for couple of hours or overnight. Enjoy!!"
