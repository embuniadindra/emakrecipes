Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, scallion hummus. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Scallion hummus is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. Scallion hummus is something which I've loved my entire life. They're nice and they look fantastic.

For this Parsley Scallion Hummus Pasta I used fresh parsley and scallions (green onions) to flavor my basic homemade hummus and give the pasta a really nice fresh, summery flavor. Unfortunately, my scallion hummus is a type of preparation for which I have no precise and recorded recipe : I start, I mix, I taste, I add stuff, I taste again, I add again, I mix again … you know what I mean. After all of this snow, I am totally ready for some Spring weather. Luckily, this hummus recipe is the perfect snack to welcome the warm months.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook scallion hummus using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.
