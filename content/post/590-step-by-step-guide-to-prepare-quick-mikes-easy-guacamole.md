recipeingredient:
- "6 medium avocados Make sure theyre soft all the way through removing any bad spots"
- "1/2-1 medium SWEET onion depending on your taste You can always add more I prefer the whole thing"
- "5 small or 23 medium vineripened tomatoes Very red inside Pink just wont do"
- "1 tbsp Garlic salt to taste I use roughly"
recipeinstructions:
- "Scoop out the avocados into the bowl."
- "Finely chop half the onion and most of the tomatoes and add to bowl."
- "Mash and stir vigorously, adding a light dusting of garlic salt a few times as you stir."
- "Taste often as you slowly add the rest of the onions and tomatoes, and more garlic salt, stirring as you go. I usually end up adding in all of the onion and tomatoes, and roughly 1-2 tablespoons of garlic salt."
- "Serve with tortilla chips!"
- "Good to eat immediately, but better when refrigerated for at least an hour to let the flavors sink in. When you store it, take a piece of plastic wrap, coat one side with lemon or lime juice, and place that side down directly on the guacamole inside the bowl, pressing it down firmly to squeeze most of the air out. This will help prevent the color turning."
