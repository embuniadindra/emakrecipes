recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg whites"
- "90 grams Granulated sugar"
- "90 grams Powdered sugar"
- "12 grams Cornstarch"
- "200 ml Heavy cream"
- " Sugar"
- "1 dash Vanilla extract"
- " Fruits of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the powdered sugar and the cornstarch."
- "Add the granulated sugar to the egg whites."
- "Mix the egg whites as if cutting through them."
- "Whisk at a high speed with an electric hand mixer to make stiff foam. Bring out the sticky texture of the egg whites by beating for about 10 minutes."
- "Sift in the combined powder from Step 1 in 3 batches. Mix roughly with a rubber spatula after adding the powder each time. To avoid breaking the foam, do not press the foam with the flat side of the spatula while mixing."
- "Slide the spatula into the foam horizontally, scoop some of the foam, flip over the spatula towards you, and let the foam fall. Keep rotating the bowl during this step."
- "Pipe the meringue in circles on the baking sheet lined with the parchment paper, (or scoop the meringue with a spoon and spread out into a circle)."
- "Attach a star shaped nozzle and make a wall by piping dots at the edge. If you make a double-layered wall, it will be firmer, (or make a wall roughly with a spoon)."
- "If you have time, leave the meringue base for 20 to 30 minutes to let the surface dry. It makes the result look better. To let dry quickly, I recommend you to put it in front of a heater."
- "Pipe the extra meringue into small circles and bake with the meringue base. It is good for a small snack. Crushed almonds or walnuts are good to mix with meringue for a delicious flavor."
- "Bake at 120 ℃ for 30 to 40 minutes. Turn around the baking sheet every 10 minutes while baking. When baked, let cool for a while, then place on a rack and let cool again."
- "If you have time, it is recommended not to open the oven soon after baking to let dry in residual heat. (You can leave it overnight if you bake at night.)"
- "Add the sugar and the vanilla extract to the heavy cream and whip. Pipe the whipped cream on the meringue base, and decorate the fruits. It&#39;s done."
- "The small meringues are crispy and tasty. The baking time is a little shorter than that for the pavlova, so please check the color and remove from the oven when baked."
