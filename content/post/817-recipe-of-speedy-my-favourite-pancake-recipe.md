recipeingredient:
- "4/5 cup flour"
- "1 1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tbsp sugar"
- "1 egg"
- "1/2 cup milk"
- "2 tbsp butter melted"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift all dry ingredients together in a large bowl"
- "Whisk eggs and milk"
- "Add dry mix gradually, but don&#39;t overmix! Just enough to hydrate all ingredients"
- "Add melted butter and stir to incorporate"
- "On a dry nonstick pan on medium heat, spoon on batter in a circle and end on centre to form a mound. Don&#39;t move it!"
- "Once air bubbles begin to form, check the bottom for colour. If it&#39;s a nice even tan, flip it over! Usually it takes 3 minutes first side, and 2 on the second"
- "Top it off! Okay, here&#39;s my contribution:  Sweet: I like to serve them with a coconut milk syrup (leftover from prev recipe). 1 tbsp condensed milk mixed with 1 tbsp coconut milk makes a creamy and refreshing sauce!  Savoury: My friends don&#39;t understand this, but these pancakes are neutral enough to be made savoury. Sprinkle on shredded cheddar when warm, and drizzle with ketchup and mustard. Seriously, try it. Or if you&#39;re classically canadian, drizzle on that maple syrup!"
