recipeingredient:
- "1 block Tofu"
- "310 grams White flour"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Baking powder"
- "2 tbsp Mayonnaise"
recipeinstructions:
- "Microwave the tofu for 3 minutes. Shake ● ingredients in a bag. If you microwave the tofu after crumbling it, you need 280 ~ 300 g of flour. (Please adjust it depending on how much water the tofu retains.) If it&#39;s a little firm, add milk."
- "When the tofu is cooled, remove the excess water with a paper towel, and put the tofu back in the bag. Add mayonnaise, and mix. Let it sit in the fridge at least for 30 minutes (dusting with flour is optional.)"
- "Preheat the oven to 200℃ / 390℉. Place the dough in the middle of the bag, and roll it out 1.5 ~ 2 cm thick. Cut out shapes with a cookie cutter."
- "Bake them for 10 minutes at 200℃ / 390℉ If nothing sticks to a toothpick after poking them, they are done. I cut out shapes with a 6 cm diameter cup this time (Grease the edges)."
- "A small amount of dough makes the result fluffier, but it&#39;s difficult to handle. Adjust the amount accordingly."
