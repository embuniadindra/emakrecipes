- "SPICE PASTE - Blend all ingredients for SPICE PASTE to a smooth paste. Add small amounts of water to help the process but do not flood it. Use just enough to keep the blades moving. Hardy herbs/rhizomes like galangal should be cut small first before blending, so there are no long fibrous strands to contend with when eating."

- "2. Add spice paste carefully. It will sizzle and splatter. Stir to prevent burning."
- "3. Allow to cook for 6 -12 mins until ‚Äòoil breaks‚Äô and separates from paste or when dry, clumpy and translucent. We are just seeing that everything is cooked through in the spice paste before proceeding."
- "4. Add 2 cups of water and tamarind juice just before it dries out and burns, season the sambal with salt, palm sugar and date sugar."
- "5. Stir and lower heat to prevent burning. It should still be gently bubbling. Add the optional knot of pandan leaves to lend a vanilla-like aroma."
- "6. Allow the sambal to come together, every few minutes giving it a swirl to prevent burning. Add water if it begins to dry out ‚Äì not too much, no more than half cup each time."
- "7. When the oil floats and the color has changed to a dark crimson shade, the sambal is done (about 35 mins)."
- "8. Adjust with salt or additional tamarind juice to increase sourness. Turn off the heat, remove the pandan knot if added."
- "9. When the sambal has cooled down, spoon in honey and mix well. Keep refrigerated or freeze in small batches for reuse on another day or when you make Nasi Lemak."
