- "280 g selfraising flour"
- "200 g light soft brown sugar"

- "squeeze lemon juice"
- "handful toffees"
- " little icing sugar for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line cupcake tray with cases, I used 15 however it will be dependent on the size you are using. (If making a cake, grease and line a 20 x 30cm baking tray with baking parchment.)"
- "Put the dates and milk in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and set aside for 15 mins to cool."
- "Whizz the date mixture to a smooth purée in a food processor or blender, then scrape into a large mixing bowl. Tip in the butter, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, eggs, mixed spice and vanilla, and set aside while you prepare the apples."
- "Quarter and core the apples, then slice quite thinly, tossing in a little lemon juice as you go."
- "Quickly beat together the cake ingredients with an electric whisk until smooth, then scrape into the cases (or tray for the cake)"
- "Arrange the apple slices, for cupcakes, two to three per cupcake. (For the cake: overlap the apple in rows, on top – you should be able to get 3 rows lengthways down the tray.)"
- "Bake for 20-30 mins until a skewer poked into the centre of one of the cupcake comes out clean. Cool in the tray. (If baking as one cake it will require at least 50-60mins)"
- "Put the toffees in a small pan with a good splash of milk and gently melt, stirring, until runny. To finish, dust with a little icing sugar, then drizzle sauce over the cakes."
