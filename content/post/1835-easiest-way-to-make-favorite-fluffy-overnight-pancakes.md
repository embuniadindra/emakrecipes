- "200 gr flour"
- "21 gr baking powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
- "34 gr sugar"
- "50 gr milk powder"
- "1 egg"
- "60 gr butter"
- "250 ml water"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, *sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth."
- "Important:  Do not over mix, small lumps is okay. Cover bowl with wrap and let this mixture sit in the refrigerator overnight. This allows more air bubbles to form, insuring a light and fluffy pancake."
- "Next morning:  Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat, or spray a griddle pan with non-stick spray. Without stirring (which would deflate the air bubbles), scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.  (You can use a ¼ c. (or larger) measuring cup.  I use a levered ice cream scoop).  Brown on both sides and serve hot."
- "You can embellish these any way you like, by adding blueberries, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. to the pancake batter on the griddle, just before turning it over to brown on the second side."
