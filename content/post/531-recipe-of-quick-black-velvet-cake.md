- "Prepare the frosting.  In a large bowl, add cream cheese.  Using a hand or stand mixer, whip until light and fluffy.  Add in demerara sugar powder.  *To make demerara sugar powder, simply blitz until powder forms in a spice grinder or blender.*"
- "Continue whipping until well combined.  Add in the whipping cream.  Whip until stiff peaks form.  Spread this frosting on top of the cake.  Lastly, dust with some cocoa powder.  Slice and serve warm or chilled."
