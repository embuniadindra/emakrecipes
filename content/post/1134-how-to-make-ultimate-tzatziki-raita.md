Hey everyone, it's Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, tzatziki raita. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Tzatziki Raita is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look wonderful. Tzatziki Raita is something which I have loved my entire life.

Raita is a side dish from India while tzatziki is a Greek sauce. Both are eaten as dips or as an accompaniment to a main dish. Raita is made with plain yogurt and tzatziki is made with thicker Greek yogurt. Both generally involve some sort of herbaceous element: for tzatziki that means dill, mint, or parsley; cilantro often makes an appearance in raita recipes.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have tzatziki raita using 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki Raita:

1. Take 1 cup yogurt
1. Make ready 1/2 cup chopped cucumber(with peels)
1. Get 8-10 leaves fresh mint
1. Take 2-3 cloves fresh garlic
1. Take 1/4 spoon salt
1. Prepare pinch black pepper


Raita and tzatziki share two similar base ingredients and some similar steps, but they are distinctly different. First, raita starts with dahi, a thinner salted yogurt, while tzatziki starts with thicker plain Greek yogurt. Tzatziki also has a heavy dose of lemon juice, making it decidedly more tangy than raita. Like it&#39;s Greek cousin, tzatziki, raita is a delicious, refreshing combination of yogurt, herbs, cucumber and either garlic or onion.

Like it&#39;s Greek cousin, tzatziki, raita is a delicious, refreshing combination of yogurt, herbs, cucumber and either garlic or onion. Some may see this as a desperate attempt to make something other than enchiladas or salsa verde with my bounty of tomatillos but I&#39;m going to stick with sort of genius. Not full on genius, that&#39;s reserved for novels. Resembling the popular Greek condiment tzatziki, raita is also made using thick yoghurt, which is then mixed with a variety of vegetables, fruits and spices.
