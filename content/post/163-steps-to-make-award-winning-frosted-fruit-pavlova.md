- "And in the sugar tablespoon by tablespoon while still whisking and keep doing this until the sugar has all been used. It should look quite glossy."
- "Add in the rest of the meringue ingredients and whisk one more time."
- "With the large metal spoon, being careful not to mix too much, spoon the mixture within the circle you have drawn."
- "Spread out the mixture and try to have the outer circle higher up than the middle so it looks a bit like a tart."
- "Put the meringue into the oven for 1 hour. Then leave in the oven until the oven has cooled down."
- "Meanwhile make the frosted fruits. Gently whisk the egg white so it is a little frothy but not stiff like the meringue."
- "Put a handful of sugar on a small plate and have it next to the bowl with the whisked egg white."
- "Take the fruit and dip it first in the egg white and then roll it around on the sugar plate before transferring to a piece of baking parchment."
- "Repeat this until you have coated all the fruit you wish to use. You may need to top up your sugar plate and you may find the egg will make the sugar very wet."
- "Leave the fruit to dry and harden."
- "Once the meringue has cooled and the fruit has hardened, whip the double cream and then dollop and spread in the middle of the meringue. Arrange the fruit artistically and voila!"
