recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg"
- "80 grams Cake flour"
- "10 grams Cornstarch"
- "90 grams Sugar"
- "15 grams Butter"
- "2 tsp Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soften the butter and milk in a microwave and melt together over a pan of warm water. Sift together the cake flour and cornstarch."
- "Break 3 eggs into a bowl and beat together with a hand mixer. Preheat the oven to 180℃."
- "Add the sugar to the eggs and continue to whisk together with a hand mixer, taking the whisk from a low speed to a higher speed gradually over a double boiler at 80℃ for approx. 7 minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on the temperature of the double boiler, if the eggs become too hot, the cake will turn out dry and crumbly."
- "After 7 minutes, when the mixture is warm to the touch and has started to thicken, take it off the double boiler. Continue to whisk for a futher 2 - 3 minutes, cooling the mixture. If the mixture is hard to cool try whipping it suspended over a bowl of cold water."
- "Whip until the mixture sticks to the beaters thickly when you lift them out of the bowl. Keep whipping until it slowly falls off the beater when picked up."
- "Add 1 tablespoon of cold water to the mixture to make it easier to mix in the powder ingredients. Remove the beaters from the hand mixer, and use them on their own to mix."
- "Sift in the powder ingredients in 2 - 3 goes and fold in each time, folding from the bottom of the bowl to mix. Mix carefully allowing the mixture to pass through the blades of the whisk."
- "When there is a small amount of powder still remaining, take the warmed butter and milk mixture and add 1 scoop of the cake mixture to it. Mix it in well before distributing the butter and milk mixture all over the cake mixture and mixing thoroughly."
- "This is how the mixture should look when everything is mixed together. If you&#39;ve whisked it enough the mixture should be nice and thick."
- "Pour the mixture into a cake tin. To get rid of the excess air bubbles spray some water on the surface and smooth it out."
- "Bake the cake in a steam oven for 30 minutes at 180℃. For those without a steam function on their oven, simply add a heat resistant plate filled with water alongside the cake."
- "This is the cake after 20 minutes, it&#39;s risen quite a lot here."
- "Once baked, drop the cake tin lightly onto the surface from a height of about 30 cm to elminate the hot air. Remove from the pan to cool, and once cooled, remove the baking paper."
- "Turn the cake upside down and leave to cool on a wire rack. Wrap it with cling film, leave it to rest and it&#39;s done."
- "A birthday cake for a 3-year-old that I made."
- "This is a birthday cake for 4 years old that I made."
- "A cake I made for a Christmas party."
