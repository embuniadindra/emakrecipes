recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Mascarpone cheese"
- "2 Egg yolks"
- "1 Egg white"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "100 ml Heavy cream"
- "2 tbsp Rum"
- "1 box Ladyfingers"
- "150 ml Espresso"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Milk"
- "1 Cocoa powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "You will need 3 bowls, an electric hand mixer, and a whisk. I recommend making this the day before serving."
- "In the first bowl, add the egg yolks and sugar and mix with an electric hand mixer until the batter turns white."
- "In the second bowl, add the egg whites and whip with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form."
- "In the third bowl, add the heavy cream and whip with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form. (Be careful not to over-whisk the cream, otherwise it will dry out.)"
- "From this point on, set aside the electric hand mixer, change to a whisk and mix gently and carefully. To the first bowl, add the mascarpone cheese and mix until the mixture is smooth."
- "Once the mixture is smooth, add the egg whites and mix. Add the whipped cream and gently mix until the batter is evenly mixed."
- "Add the rum and mix some more. (If serving to children, you can omit the rum.) The cream is ready."
- "Dissolve the ☆ sugar in the espresso and add the ☆ milk. Pour into a container with a flat bottom. (The container should be large enough so that a ladyfinger fits.)"
- "Espresso machines are handy to have at home but if you don&#39;t have one, you can grab a freshly brewed cup at Starbucks or other coffee shops. (It&#39;s fine even if it&#39;s cold.)"
- "Take one ladyfinger at a time between your fingers, soak in the espresso for a second, lift out immediately, and align the biscuits in a glass container."
- "Since ladyfingers are very light, they will melt and fall apart if you soak them for too long. Try to soak them for just a second."
- "After you align the ladyfingers in a container, pour the cream over and smooth out the top."
- "Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in the refrigerator overnight. The moisture in the cream will soften the biscuits and they&#39;ll taste really good."
- "The next day, sprinkle cocoa powder through a tea strainer just before serving, and it&#39;s done."
- "Even if you don&#39;t have time to let it sit overnight, let it sit at least for 3 hours in the refrigerator."
- "I recommend Bambini biscuits for the ladyfingers! Where I live, you can buy these in imported food stores."
