- "Grease a sheet pan and place graham crackers on the bottom of half of the pan. Use one graham cracker broken in fourths as a barrier to divide your pan."
- "Pour the original brownie mix over the graham cracker crust side and top with marshmallow cream. Crush the remaining crackers and sprinkle over the top."
- "Mix your cream cheese, egg and sugar in its own bowl."
- "Pour 1/2 the caramel swirl brownie mix on the other side of the pan and dollop spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture on top followed by the remaining caramel swirl brownie mix and the caramel packet that was included in the box mix. Use a butter knife or toothpick and gently swirl your batter."
- "Bake 30 minutes until toothpick comes out mostly clean. Cool 30 minutes before slicing!"
