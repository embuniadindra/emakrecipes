recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1 tbsp Baking powder"
- "70 grams Butter"
- "70 ml Milk or yoghurt or heavy cream"
- "1 Egg small"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Sugar"
- "50 grams Dried fruits such as raisins"
- "1 Clotted cream"
- "1 Jam"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the butter into 0.5 cm, sift the flour and baking powder together twice. Put them all into a bowl and mix together by rubbing. The mixture becomes crumbly after a few minutes. It&#39;s easier to use hands than food processor."
- "When there are no lumps of butter and the mixture becomes crumbly, make sure that there are no butter lumps left by squashing the mixture with your hands."
- "When the mixture becomes like the photo, add the sugar and your favorite dried fruits (like raisins) and stir lightly."
- "Then add the milk (or yoghurt) and beaten egg, and mix lightly to make a dough. If the dough is too soft, flour your hands a lot to gather it together. If the butter has melted and the dough is sticky, then rest the dough in a plastic bag and place in the refrigerator for more than 1 hour."
- "If the dough is not sticky, roll up and fold 3 times. Roll it out to 2.5 - 3 cm thick and cut out the shapes. The dough should be the same softness as freshly pounded rice cakes (mochi)."
- "Bake for 15-20 minutes in a preheated oven at 180°C, (or 200°C). The best way to serve is warm, but if the scones get cool, microwave for 10-20 seconds."
- "Serve with clotted cream and jam."
- "The scones get a bit burned if the cooking temperature is 200°C in our oven."
- "Serve with clotted cream or richly flovoured milk."
- "These ones made a weird face!"
- "I didn&#39;t mix the flour and butter completely for these ones and they didn&#39;t rise very well."
- "I used yoghurt instead of milk. Also added more bread flour than cake flour. Then it plumped up well, from 2.5 to 6.5 cm. The width is same."
- "I used milk. I added more flour. Then the scones did not rise higher compared with the one in step 12. But they spread out more. The length is from 2.5 to 6 cm, the width is from 5 to 6 cm."
- "This time the scones rose a lot. I rolled up the dough into 4 cm. The cooking time is longer than usual."
