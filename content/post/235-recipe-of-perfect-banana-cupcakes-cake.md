1. Prepare 1 1/4 tsp baking soda
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp salt
1. Get 1 1/2 stick butter or margarine

The riper the bananas, the smoother your cupcakes will be and the sweeter banana flavor they will have. Remember to very gently fold in the beaten egg whites for the fluffiest results!

For cupcake perfection, use power ingredients like sour cream, buttermilk, and three ripe bananas.
