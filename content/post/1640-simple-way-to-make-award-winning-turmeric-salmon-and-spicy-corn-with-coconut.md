recipeingredient:
- " 68 oz salmon fillets"
- " ground turmeric"
- " corn"
- " red onion peeled halved and cut into half moons"
- " spicy pepper I used a green Cowhorn pepper but Jalapeno is fine and easier to find"
- " fullfat coconut milk"
- " chopped cilantro if you are not a fan of coriander basil would be excllent as well"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the unhusked corn quickly and microwave it for 5 minutes. Remove from the microwave and set aside to cool down enough so that you can handle it. As soon as you can, peel away the husk and the silk (which should all come off in one piece after microwaving) and use a knife to remove all of the corn kernels from the cob. As illustrated above, I like a mix of individual kernels and attached segments. Place a quarter of the corn into one each of four soup dishes."
- "Break the cobs into halves or thirds and put them in a microwave safe dish along with the coconut milk, the chopped spicy pepper, and some salt. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. The corn will release cob juices into the coconut milk. Set aside. If using corn kernels, microwave them along with the coconut milk and ignore step 1. Set aside while you cook the salmon."
- "Prepare 4 pieces of parchment paper, each large enough to hold a piece of fish and to crimp tightly around it when folded. Place a piece of fish, skin down, on each piece of parchment paper,. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the turmeric and some salt, top with 1/4 of the onion. Crimp the paper around the fish and fold down the edges to create a sealed package."
- "Microwave on high for about 3:00 to 4:00 minutes. My fish took exactly 3 minutes to be perfectly cooked through and still just slightly translucent in the center. Open the packages carefully to avoid steam and lift the salmon out on a spatula. The skin should stay behind on the paper. If not, let sit for 30 seconds wrapped back up and the skin will peel away easily when you open the package away."
- "Remove the cobs from the coconut milk mixture, pour in any fish juices that accumulate in the parchment packages and stir in half the chopped coriander or basil. Adjust salt if needed. Zap in the microwave for 30 seconds to bring back to hot temperature and then pour a quarter of the hot liquid into each of the soup dishes."
- "Top the corn and coconut stock in each bowl with a piece of salmon, a quarter of the onions and a quarter of the remaining chopped coriander (or basil)."
