recipeingredient:
- "3 cups all purpose flour"
- "3/4 cup sugar"
- "4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 cup (1 stick) butter cold and cubed"
- "4 oz (1/2 package) cream cheese cold and cubed"
- "2 eggs"
- " Milk enough to pull dough together"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place all the dry ingredients in either a food processor or large bowl. Pulse or stir just to combine."
- "Make sure the butter and cream cheese are COLD, cube them up and cut into dry ingredients. If you are using a food processor pulse half the butter and cream cheese at a time to prevent overworking the dough and/or clumping. If cutting in by hand you have a little more control and better looking toned up arms :)"
- "Next whisk the eggs and add to the flour mixture. Mix until worked throughout the dough."
- "The dough is still dry and crumbly at this stage, but can quickly become an over-saturated, sticky mess with this next ingredient. It&#39;s time to add more dairy. I use nonfat milk, but you can swing that pendulum all the way to heavy cream if you so desire. The important thing is to add slowly and stop as soon as the dough pulls together."
- "Once you have a pulled together dough, dump onto a lightly floured surface. Using your lightly floured hands flatten (to about 1/4&#34;or 1/2&#34; thickness) and shape dough into a rough rectangle for cutting. Using a pizza cutter, cut dough into desired shapes."
- "Transfer scones to ungreased cookie sheet. Leave plenty of room between the scones. Bake at 350 degrees for about 17 minutes."
- "Scones are done once they start to lightly brown, do not over bake."
- "Cool on racks and decide if you want to drizzle with a powder sugar glaze or chocolate."
