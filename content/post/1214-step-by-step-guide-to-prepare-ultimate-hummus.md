recipeinstructions:
- "Thoroughly rinse and strain the chick peas. Mince the garlic cloves. Squeeze the juice out of the lemons and strain the pits out."

- "Add 2 handfuls of chick peas at a time to the processor. Mix for 1 minute, scrape the sides, and mix again for 30 seconds. Continue this until all chick peas are blended."
- "The hummus will be rather thick at this point, so add water in small increments (like 3-4 tbs at a time) and blend well until you have the desired consistency."
- "Garnish the finished hummus with cilantro for added flavor and enjoy!"
