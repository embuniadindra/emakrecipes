- "Trim any fat, butterfly and pound down your chicken breasts until they&#39;re equal thickness on all sides."
- "Remove chicken from brine and grill on high for three minutes on each side. Longer if your chicken pieces are on the thicker side. You&#39;ll want to create some char lines on them so try not to lift or peek."

- "Stack your sandwiches any way you choose to. [lettuce first tho] with your warmed leftover Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ Sauce that&#39;s in your pan."
- "Serve with a salad like my, &#34;Mike&#39;s Tangy Garden Fresh Summer Salad.&#34; Enjoy!"
