- "Cut into shapes using a knife or cut out with a cookie cutter."
- "Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes at 170℃."
- "They are also delicious with some dried fruits, chocolate, etc."

- "If you want to make beautifully layered scones, roll out the dough and fold in 2~3 times."
- "Adjust your oven accordingly. The scones will be light colored when you bake them at 170℃. They will be golden brown when you bake them at 180℃."
