recipeingredient:

- "5 medium eggs"
- "50 g water"
- "50 g unsalted butter melted"
- " Red blue yellow green purple food coloring"
- "1 box Redmans whip topping"

recipeinstructions:
- "Put in all the ingredients, except butter, into an electric mixer with whisk attached. Whisk on high speed for 8-10mins until fluffy."
- "Fold in the melted butter gently. Do not use electric mixer."
- "Separate the batter into 5 equal portions. If you want more colors, separate into more portions."
- "Colour each portion with red, yellow green, blue, purple coloring. I used Wilton&#39;s gel coloring. If you have more colorings, feel free to colour more portions of the batter."
- "Put each batter into different piping bags."
- "Line muffin tray with cupcake cups."
- "Pipe out the colored batters into the cups, layer by layer, as desired. Not too much though. You&#39;ll want to fill up just slightly below the top of the cupcake cups. The more you fill up, the higher your cupcake will rise."
- "Bake at 150 degs for abt 5-8mins at middle rack, depending on oven. My oven is small, so temperature needs to be lower. Adjust your oven temperature accordingly."

- "Cool the cupcakes completely onto cooling rack. Meanwhile, let&#39;s prepare frosting."
- "For frosting, I just use whipped cream. Pour 1 cup of Redman&#39;s whip topping into electric mixing bowl with whisk attachment. Whisk at high speed till stiff peak. You should be able to turn the bowl upside down. With electric whisk, everything is fast! ðŸ¤£ So, invest in one!"
- "Put the whipped cream inside large piping bag with piping tip attached. Pipe out frost onto cupcakes as desired. Check out YouTube for piping techniques! They have plenty of tutorials on piping. You can even colour the frosting if you like. If you ran out of frosting, whip more cream."
- "Sprinkle rainbow rice if desire. Well done!! You&#39;ve successfully made rainbow cupcakes! Wooohooo!"
