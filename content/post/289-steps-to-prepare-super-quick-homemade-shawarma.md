Shawarma (/ ʃ ə ˈ w ɑːr m ə /; Arabic: شاورما ‎) is a dish in Middle Eastern cuisine consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Originally made of lamb or mutton, today&#39;s shawarma may also be chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates. Shawarma is a lot like a gyro, kind of like a taco, but so different in many ways.
