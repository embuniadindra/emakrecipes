- "Prep the salmon by patting dry with paper towel. Brush all sides with melted butter or canola oil. Evenly sprinkle seasoning on all sides, finishing skin side down."
- "Heat canola oil in large skillet or Dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat. Add chopped bacon and cook 4-5 minutes until starts to render and brown."

- "Add the red onion to the pan and cook another 5 minutes or so until onions start to cook"
- "Add the bell peppers and continue cooking until potatoes start to crisp and turn golden brown."
- "Shift gears- time to put the salmon on the grill. Arrange fillets over direct heat, skin side down. Be cautious not to put over direct flame. Cook about 6-8 minutes until color starts to change lighter pinks, and begins to flake."
- "While fish is grillin’, finish the hash. Reduce heat to medium or medium low. Add the minced garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Allow to finish crisping the potatoes."
- "Back to the fish- after salmon has cooked 6-8 minutes, and begins to flake, gently turn fillets over to lightly grill the top side for about 1 minute. This will add just a little color and char to the top."
- "Transfer salmon to a platter, skin side down. Lightly spritz tops of the fish with a few fresh-squeezed lemon wedges."
- "Time to plate! Make a nice bed of hash in center of the plate. Place a piece of salmon on top. The fish can be served with or without the skin as you prefer. Garnish dish with a pinch of chives or chopped green onion."

Drizzle a large dinner plate lightly with olive oil. Swipe each salmon portion through the oil (both sides) and place salmon in pan, skin side up. Place the salmon fillet on the grill skin side down (I put it over the hottest part of the grill) and cover. Place salmon on the preheated grill, and discard marinade. Place the salmon directly on the grill grates, skin-side down, and place the cover on the grill.
