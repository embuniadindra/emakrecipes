- "2 tsp vanilla preferably mexican"
- "1 cup boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° and spray a 9in×13in or two 9in pans. If you do not having cooking spray, you can butter your pans and lightly flour them."
- "Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt to a large bowl (or a mixer bowl). Whisk all ingredients together or using your paddle attachment stir until well combined."
- "Now add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs and vanilla. On medium speed mix all ingredients together until well combined."
- "Now reduce speed add the instant coffee to the boiling water and stir well. Slowly add the coffee mixture to the bowl with the batter. Once all has been added turn the speed up a notch (medium) to make sure all is combined thoroughly. *Note: The batter will be more &#34;liquid-y&#34; then store bought batter but trust me, it bakes into a moist wonderful cake full of flavor."
- "Pour the batter into your pan or pans (divide equally) and bake for 30 minutes or until inserting a toothpick in the center comes out clean."
- "Now frost with your favorite frosting. I personally love a white vanilla butter frosting to go along with this. If you haven&#39;t tried it, please do so. It is to die for! I have posted it as The Best Vanilla Butter Frosting You&#39;ve Ever Had."
