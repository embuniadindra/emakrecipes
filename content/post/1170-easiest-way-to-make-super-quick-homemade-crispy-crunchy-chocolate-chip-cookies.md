- "Let butter sit at room temperature to soften beforehand. Sift flour twice; set aside."
- "Cream the butter until smooth. Add granulated sugar in 3 parts, and mix well each time."
- "Mix well with a hand mixer on low speed until white for 4 mins. Use a spatula to transfer the edge butter into the center and mix evenly."
- "Add egg yolk. Mix well with a hand mixer on low speed until combined. Use a spatula to transfer the edge mixture into the center and mix evenly. You should scrape the batter off the hand mixer as possible, and put it back in the bowl."
- "Add salt and almond flour, and mix well with a spatula until combined. Add vanilla oil, and mix well until combined."
- "Add the flour, and fold it into the mixture while sometimes scooping the flour. Mix it until the lumps form like this (3rd photo)."
- "Add chocolate chips, and fold them into the mixture about 7 times. Scrape off the edge flour and fold it roughly into the dough."
- "Put the dough onto a work surface. Use your hands to gather lumps together. Weigh it and put half of the dough onto a work surface."

- "Cut 30g / 1 oz chocolate into very fine pieces; set aside. Melt 60g / 2 oz chocolate with a microwave until smooth to make it 40-45℃ (104-113F). Please don&#39;t heat too much to prevent separating."
- "Put the fined chocolate in the melted chocolate. Stir to melt and lower to 30-32℃ (84-89F)."

- "Chop almonds into small pieces. Top the chocolate with the chopped almonds. Let them cool in a fridge for 10-15 mins."
- "Done! Please store them in a sealed container to keep a crispy texture. It’s even better to put a desiccant in the container together."
