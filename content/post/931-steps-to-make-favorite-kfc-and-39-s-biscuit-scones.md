recipeingredient:
- "130 grams Cake flour"
- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Cornstarch or potato starch or cake flour"
- "2 pinch Salt"
- "2 tbsp Raw cane sugar"
- "1 tbsp Baking powder aluminiumfree"
- "60 grams Cold butter or trans fatfree shortening Shortening is easier to handle since it wont make the dough too soft"
- "120 ml Cold soy milk milk or yogurt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ★ dry ingredients into a bowl, and mix together with a whisk. Put butter on top and coat with the dry ingredients."
- "Holding your whisk vertically, tap it up and down to cut up the butter and to crumble the butter-flour mixture. Be careful not to knead!"
- "When the butter bits are crumbly, add milk and mix with a spatula, being careful not to knead. I used whole wheat flour here."
- "When the dough has become more or less cohesive, stop mixing. Press with your hands into a lump of dough. Even if it starts out crumbly, it will come together as you fold."
- "If you have time, wrap the dough in plastic film and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. You could also skip this step. Press the dough flat with your palms or a rolling pin, and dust the top lightly with flour."
- "Fold the dough in half, then press flat again. Repeat the fold-and-press 2 to 3 times. There&#39;s no need to roll it out carefully as you would with cookies."
- "Finally, roll the dough out with a rolling pin 2 cm thick. Cut the dough out with a cup. Bake in a preheated 200 C (392 F) oven for 15 to 20 minutes and they&#39;re done."
- "If you look at the bottom of the scones and they are a nice golden brown, they are done. Enjoy with plenty of maple syrup."
- "To make in a food processor: Freeze the butter, put in the food processor with the ★ ingredients, and pulse to chop up the butter."
- "Process briefly until the butter bits are about the size of rice grains and the flour is a little grainy. Add cold soy milk, and pulse again."
- "When the flour starts to clump, process briefly again, and stop as soon as a dough ball is formed. Transfer to a plastic bag. Procede from Step 7."
