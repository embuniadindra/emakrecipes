recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F."
- "In your stand mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt."
- "Cut cold butter into 1 inch cubes, put on top of dry ingredients."
- "Using your paddle attachment to work up to medium speed, beat butter with dry ingredients until butter has crumbled into smaller pieces and mixture is consistent. This might take a few minutes- be patient! You can stop halfway through, use a fork to scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix up the butter a bit more if needed."

Cut a criss cross diagonally through both squares to get 8 large scones. *To get 16 smaller scones, cut each triangle in half. The scones will bake up slightly bigger, and they&#39;re the perfect size for a snack or with breakfast."
- "Place onto parchment-lined cookie sheet, about one to two inches apart."
- "For 8 large scones, bake 15-17 min or until golden brown."
- "For 16 small scones, adjust baking time to 11-13 min or until golden brown."
- "To make the lemon glaze, combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Add a little more or less lemon juice to get the consistency you like. Drizzle over cooled scones."
