recipeinstructions:

- "Mash and stir vigorously, adding a light dusting of garlic salt a few times as you stir."
- "Taste often as you slowly add the rest of the onions and tomatoes, and more garlic salt, stirring as you go. I usually end up adding in all of the onion and tomatoes, and roughly 1-2 tablespoons of garlic salt."
- "Serve with tortilla chips!"
- "Good to eat immediately, but better when refrigerated for at least an hour to let the flavors sink in.

This will help prevent the color turning."
