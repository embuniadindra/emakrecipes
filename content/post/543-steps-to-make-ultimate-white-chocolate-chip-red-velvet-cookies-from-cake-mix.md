- "FOR SMALL COOKIES: Scoop out 1 tbs of dough, form a ball, space out 12 balls per cookie sheet and bake 8-10 minutes (follow same guidelines as large to determine doneness, again only baking 1 sheet at a time)."
- "Remove from oven. Cool on baking sheet 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (or, ya know, sneak a couple with a nice cold glass of milk while still warm). Enjoy!"
