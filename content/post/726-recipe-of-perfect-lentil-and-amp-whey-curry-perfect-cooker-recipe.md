recipeingredient:
- " sprinkle of olive oil"
- "1/4 cup red lentils"
- "1 clove garlic pressed or chopped into small pieces"
- "1/2 medium sized onion sliced"
- "1 tbsp desiccated coconut"
- "1/4 tsp chili powder"
- "1/2 tsp ground cumin"
- "1/2 tsp ground coriander"
- "1/4 tsp turmeric"
- "1/2 cup whey or stockwater"
- "1 tsp white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar"
- "1/2 medium carrot sliced in fairly thick pieces"
- "1/2 red pepper sliced"
- "to taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coat the Perfect Cooker cup with a sprinkle of olive oil"
- "Put the lentils in the Perfect Cooker pot with the garlic, onion, coconut and spices."
- "Add the whey (or other liquid, which could be any flavour of stock or other cooking liquid). I made cheese at the weekend, so have quite a lot of whey left over, so I used whey in the recipe tonight instead of my usual chicken stock. The whey adds a much sweeter flavour, and the white wine vinegar complements this to produce a balanced sweet and sour flavour."
- "Layer the vegetables on top - I used carrot and pepper tonight. Carrot works particularly well in this, producing a really sweet taste. The texture of carrot remains if you chop these roughly rather than into think slices."
- "You can also add some meat, such as slices of ham or chorizo, but I prefer this as a vegetarian dish."
- "That&#39;s it - press &#34;cook&#34; on the Perfect Cooker."
- "You can leave it to complete cooking undisturbed, but I generally give it a stir after about 10 minutes to stop lentils sticking to the bottom."
- "Spoon on to a plate/bowl top serve."
- "Optionally, add yoghurt and spinach leaves on top."
