recipeinstructions:
- "In a saucepan, combine the Cinnamon Brown Sugar Mixture and stir on low heat until butter has melted."

- "Cook like you would a normal pancake and repeat steps for the additional pancakes."
- "When plating, use some of the Cinnamon Brown sugar mixture and spread on top opposed to using butter. It gives that extra drool while eating."

- "If you want to build muscle tone for the day, you can mix by hand, but an electric mixer is recommended."
