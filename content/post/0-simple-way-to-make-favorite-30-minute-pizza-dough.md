We like a thicker crust so I place the dough ball in a lightly greased mixing bowl, cover it with a clean, damp dish towel and My cookie sheets are different sizes so the same amount of dough in the smaller pan makes thicker crust pizza. Top crust with favorite pizza sauce and toppings. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Days like this are the perfect time to whip up some quick pizza dough and have a fun family pizza decorating party.
