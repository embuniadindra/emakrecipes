- "Off the fire, put in your cheese and spring onion and stir!"
- "Cheese: mozarella will make your mac n pasta dry when they cooling down. If you want to keep you mac n cheese moist and wet just add cheddar. If you want some colour find a red cheddar. Mine is normal white cheddar, mozarella and emmental cheese. Hence the colour. I suggest shredded or thin slices will work well and fast."
