recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Pancake mix homemade with flour  ID 1637718 Storebought mix is okay too"
- "50 grams Chilled butter or transfat free shortening"
- "100 ml Chilled soy milk or yogurt"
- " Filling Ingredients"
- "1 handful  as much as you want Honey roasted peanuts"
- "1 handful  as much as you want Chocolate or caramel walnuts etc choose your favorite chunky filling"
recipeinstructions:
- "I use the honey flavored roasted peanuts sold in stores like Kaldi."
- "Add the homemade hotcake mix ingredients (or the store bought mix) to a bowl. Place the butter on top. Cover the butter with flour from the edges to form a flour membrane."
- "Hold the whisk vertically and repeatedly stab the butter to cut it up. It will form little balls like minced meat. Be careful not to knead it in!"
- "When the butter has formed little balls of dough, add the nuts and roughly stir them in. Add the milk and cut it in without kneading."
- "When the flour has almost been completely blended in, stop mixing right away and use your hands to bring it together in one lump. It&#39;s okay to strongly bring it together!"
- "If you have the time, cover it in plastic wrap and let it chill for 15 minutes. Use a rolling pin (or your palm) over the wrap to flatten and stretch it out. Dust with a light layer of flour."
- "Fold the dough in half and push to stretch it out again. Fold it in half again and repeat 3 times. (You don&#39;t need to be gentle while stretching it out like when you&#39;re making cookies)"
- "Roll it out with a rolling pin into a 3-4 cm thick oblong shape, as seen in the picture. Divide it into halves from the center of the dough."
- "Next, divide the halves into diagonal halves to form triangles. From this size, you can get 4 scones. You can change the size if you want to make 8 scones."
- "Cut off the top, bottom, and both sides. Combine them into one clump to make one more scone for tasting. Cutting off the sides lets the dough crack easily while baking."
- "Preheat an oven to 200째C and then lower it to 180째C and bake for 15-20 minutes. If making 8 smaller scones, bake for 15 minutes. Once the bottom of the scones have turned golden brown, they are finished."
