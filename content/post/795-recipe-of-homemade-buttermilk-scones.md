recipeingredient:
- " Dough"
- "3 cup Allpurpose flour"
- "1/3 cup Sugar"
- "2 1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp Baking soda"
- "3/4 tsp Salt"
- "6 oz Butter unsalted cold cut into small pieces"
- "1 cup Buttermilk"
- "1 tbsp Lemon zest"
- " Sugar Topping"
- "2 oz Butter unsalted melted for brushing"
- "1/4 cup Sugar for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "Position the oven racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat to 425?F."
- "In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt with a fork."
- "Add the cold butter pieces and, using your fingertips (or pastry blender or two knives), work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles course cornmeal. ***Its okay if some larger pieces of butter remain; it makes the scones flakier.***"
- "Pour in the buttermilk, add the zest, and mix with a fork until the ingredients are just moistened - you&#39;ll have a soft dough with a rough look. (If the dough looks dry, add another tablespoon of buttermilk.)"
- "Gather the dough into a ball, pressing it gently so it holds together, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead it very briefly (about a dozen turns)."
- "Cut the dough in half."
- "Roll one of the dough halves into a 1/2-inch thick circle about 7 inches across."
- "Brush the dough with half of the melted butter and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the sugar."
- "Cut the circle into 6 triangles and place on a baking sheet."
- "Repeat steps 7-9 with the other half of the dough."
- "Bake the scones for 10 to 12 minutes, until both the tops and bottoms are golden."
- "Transfer the scones to a rack to cool slightly. These are best served warm but are just fine at room temperature."
- "STORING: If you are not going to eat the scones the day they are made, wrap them airtight and freeze; they&#39;ll stay fresh for a month. To serve, defrost the scones at room temperature in their wrappers, then unwrap and reheat on a baking sheet for 5 minute in a 350?F oven."
