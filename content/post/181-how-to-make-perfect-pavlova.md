- "1 x tsp cornflour"
- "1 x tsp vanilla extract"
- " for the toppings"
- "300 ml x double cream"
- "450 g x mixed berries"

recipeinstructions:
- "Before separating the eggs make sure that your stand mixer and whisk are super clean, I use boiling water and soap but you can use lemon juice of vinegar. Add whites to mixer and whisk until very fluffy (like shaving foam)"
- "Now keep the mixer on low - medium speed while you add the sugar 1 spoon at a time and them mix on high until the mixture is velvety smooth and when you rub the meringue between your finger and thumb you do not feel any sugar granules. Now add the corn flour and cream of tartar followed by vanilla."
- "There are 2 ways to make the pavlova this one uses a piping bag with a star nozzle, fill the bag with meringue then use a little mixture under the baking parchment to secure the paper in a fan oven."
- "Start in the centre and spiral out to about 10 inches approx, then continue to pipe up on the edge of disc to create a tart case shape, I then created small peaks around the rim."
- "The second technique is far simpler, dollop mixture in the centre of the lined tray and with a spoon spread it out to desired shape and drag some mixture up at the rim to create the tart shape. Bake at 130c for about 1 hour 20 minutes or until the outer edge is set and a slight change in colour. Now turn off the oven and leave the meringues to cool in the oven for 2 hours."
- "When fully cooled remove meringue from parchment with a pallet knife, whisk cream to soft peak (no sugar) and fill the meringue with as much cream as you like."
- "Smooth out the cream then prepare your fruit, I used a mixture of berries and cut the strawberries into halves and quarters, then scattered over the cream."
- "I then added the raspberries and blueberries, a nice extra finishing touch is to glaze with melted apricot jam with a splash of water and some mint sprigs."
- "It&#39;s ready get stuck in, the meringue is chewy because of the corn flour and you will need a spoon and fork to eat it. These images are taken from my youtube channel feel free to check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyP1Naq4G80&amp;t=20s"
