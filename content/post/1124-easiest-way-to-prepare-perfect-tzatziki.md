Find Deals on Tatziki in Seasonings on Amazon. Add lemon zest, dill, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth. You can serve it immediately, but I prefer to allow the tzatziki to sit in the refrigerator for. In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki:

1. Get  strained yogurt or anthotyro
1. Make ready  fresh cucumber
1. Take  garlic
1. Prepare  olive oil
1. Get  salt, white pepper
1. Make ready  ouzo
1. Prepare  fresh herbs like parsley, dill, spearmint


To be truly superb, tzatziki MUST be made with strained, whole mild yogurt from Greece, otherwise the result will be runny as many users have noted. Also lemon juice is preferable to vinegar. But the one non-negotiable item is the strained, full fat yogurt. Tzatziki is made simply with yogurt, drained cucumber, olive oil, fresh herbs (usually mint or dill), garlic, lemon juice and salt.
