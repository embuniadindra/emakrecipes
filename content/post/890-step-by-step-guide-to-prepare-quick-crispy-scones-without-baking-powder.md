- "32 grams Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "70 grams Margarine salted"
- "1 Egg medium"
- "1 dash Milk"
- "1 A thick plastic bag"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200℃. Put the ★ ingredients into a plastic bag."
- "Let some air inside, and shake the bag to mix together."
- "Then add the margarine. Mash it to coat the margarine with flour."
- "When there are few lumps, massage the mixture in the bag with both hands to make a sandy texture."
- "Break the egg into a measuring cup to beat. Add enough milk to make 70 ml and mix well."
- "Make a hole in the centre of the mixture, pour in the egg mixture, add some air inside to shake the bag."
- "When the mixture forms a dough, stop shaking it. A floury texture is fine. Push lightly on top to make a 3 cm thickness dough."
- "Tear the dough into suitable sizes to shape the round balls. But do not knead nor roll it."
- "Rough surfaces make for a delicious texture. You don&#39;t have to worry too much about chunks of margarine that haven&#39;t been mixed in completely."
- "Bake for 22 minutes in a 200℃ preheated oven. When they become light brown, they are done. Adjust the cooking time depending on your oven."
- "They are delicious as is, but I prefer to serve them with heavy cream and apple jam."
- "If you add chocolate or dried fruits, add them in Step 4, then shake to mix together and add the egg mixture."
- "Of course, you don&#39;t have to use a plastic bag."
- "Adjust the amount of egg mixture, depending on the type of margarine and room temperature. For me, 70 ml is the best."
