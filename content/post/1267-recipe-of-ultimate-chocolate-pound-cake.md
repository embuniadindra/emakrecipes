- "100 g granulated sugar"
- "100 g egg from 2 mediumsize eggs room temperature"
- "80 g cake flour"

- "Heat milk, instant coffee, and chocolate until fully melted and stir to combine. Set aside to cool."
- "Using a hand mixer or simply a hand-whisk, cream the butter for 1 minute until fully-softened. Add sugar and beat until fluffy and lightened in color. Frequently scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula for even mix."
- "Lightly beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Then add them into the butter mixture in 3 additions. Mix just until combined after every addition. If we add all eggs at once, both of these high-fat ingredients might not combine but end up separating."
- "Add all of the dry ingredients. Make sure to sieve the flour, baking powder, and cocoa powder beforehand as they tend to clump. Mix until 90% combined."
- "Add the melted chocolate. Mix just until combined. Do not overmix as it will develop the gluten too much and result in a tough cake."
- "Transfer into a loaf pan that has been fully coated with butter. This will help unmold the cake easily."
- "Spread up the batter to both ends of the pan. Pipe a line of softened butter along the center lengthwise. These steps are optional, but they will help create an evenly-centered crack."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 340째F (170째C) for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean."
- "Run a spatula between the cake and the pan. Unmold the cake immediately after baking to prevent shrinking. Let cool on the cooling rack. With a sifter, garnish the top with icing sugar before slicing (optional)."
