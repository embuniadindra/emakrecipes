recipeingredient:
- "1 lb corn tortillas cut in pizza eighths"
- "6 roma tomatoes"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tsp dried garlic"
- "2 tsp dried onion"
- "pinch oregano"
- "to taste salt"
- "to taste pepper"
- "2 tbsp sweet and sour sauce"
- "to taste cheese use a cheese that melts easily We had Mexican Oaxaca cheese on hand but mozzarella of Monterey Jack work well too"
- "to taste sour cream"
- "as needed vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lay out the tortilla wedges on a cloth to dry (for as long as possible, we had them drying since yesterday) Heat sufficient vegetable oil in a deep pan and fry the chips (in batches, if need be) until crispy and golden. Place them in a colander to discard excess oil."
- "In a medium pot, place the tomatoes and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until the skin bursts."
- "In a food processor, add: olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper, onion, garlic, the sweet and sour sauce. Process until smooth, then add the tomatoes, one at a time, and puree. You should get a bright red sauce. Return to pot and simmer until it bubbles."
- "To plate: heap some tortilla chips on a plate, cover with the cheese and drench in the sauce (which should be as hot as possible so it melts the cheese). Let it rest for a bit for the cheese to melt and the tortillas to absorb some of the sauce. Then, add the sour cream. Your Mexican/Chinese fusion Chinaquiles are ready!"
- "NOTE: you can add some shredded chicken, or some cooked ground beef, or sliced onions, or pretty much anything your heart desires. It&#39;s quite a versatile dish!"
