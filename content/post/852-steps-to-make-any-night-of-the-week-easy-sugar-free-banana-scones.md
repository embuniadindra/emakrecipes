- "1 Banana overripe"
- "200 grams Pancake mix"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the banana to a bowl and mash it with a fork. Then, still using the fork, mix it together with the pancake mix until the dough comes together."
- "Continue to mix the dough until it becomes a little sticky, then turn it out onto a dusted surface and flatten it out into a circle with the palms of your hands (the dough should be about 5 cm thick). Cut the dough into 8 equal portions (as if you were cutting a cake) and bake them on a baking tray at 190°C for 15 minutes."
- "I tried adding walnuts to the scones on the left and chocolate chips to those on the right and cutting them into rectangles. It seems that this way is better for kids."
